    <p>Italy, country of south-central Europe, occupying a peninsula that juts deep into the Mediterranean Sea. Italy comprises some of the most varied and scenic landscapes on Earth and is often described as a country shaped like a boot. At its broad top stand the Alps, which are among the world’s most rugged mountains. Italy’s highest points are along Monte Rosa, which peaks in Switzerland, and along Mont Blanc, which peaks in France. The western Alps overlook a landscape of Alpine lakes and glacier-carved valleys that stretch down to the Po River and the Piedmont. Tuscany, to the south of the cisalpine region, is perhaps the country’s best-known region. From the central Alps, running down the length of the country, radiates the tall Apennine Range, which widens near Rome to cover nearly the entire width of the Italian peninsula. South of Rome the Apennines narrow and are flanked by two wide coastal plains, one facing the Tyrrhenian Sea and the other the Adriatic Sea. Much of the lower Apennine chain is near-wilderness, hosting a wide range of species rarely seen elsewhere in western Europe, such as wild boars, wolves, asps, and bears. The southern Apennines are also tectonically unstable, with several active volcanoes, including Vesuvius, which from time to time belches ash and steam into the air above Naples and its island-strewn bay. At the bottom of the country, in the Mediterranean Sea, lie the islands of Sicily and Sardinia</p>

                  <p>Dubai’s population has grown steadily over the past two centuries, from just a few thousand local inhabitants to well over two million. Most of the early population increases were due to merchants from neighbouring countries choosing to relocate to Dubai’s business-friendly environment. In the later 20th century the city’s construction boom led to a huge increase in the number of South Asian labourers and an influx of skilled expatriates from all over the world who play an important role in Dubai’s multi-sector economy. Expatriates in the city vastly outnumber native Emiratis. With the</p>

                <h2>ROME</h2>
                <div class="container">
                  <p>Both for its history as the capital of much of ancient Europe and for its present day role as one of Europe's most vibrant cities, for most tourists traveling to Italy, Rome heads the list of places to visit. Relics of its ancient glories—the Colosseum, the Forum, the Pantheon, the Appian Way, and the Palatine Hill—vie with the vast riches of the Vatican as the top attractions.Italy may not be a very big country, but it packs plenty of attractions into a small space. Even the most energetic tourist can't expect to see it all at once. You can see the very top highlights in one trip, or you can choose one region to explore in more depth.
    
                    When planning your Italy itinerary, remember that time you spend traveling from place to place is time you won't have to explore the fascinating corners of the places you stop. That's where Italy's fast and efficient (and on time) train network will help you.
                    
                    But trains are not the best way to see and experience one of Italy's greatest charms–its small towns and villages, often perched on hilltops amid rolling landscapes of green fields and poppy-painted meadows. These breathe history, and in their atmospheric streets, you'll have a better chance to meet and interact with the country's greatest treasure–its people.
                    
                    But there are plenty of options. In these itineraries, you'll find the most famous sights: the Tower of Pisa, the Grand Canal, the Colosseum, and others, but you'll also find suggestions for trips that take you into the very heart of Italy, and to places your friends have never seen. Plan your trip to Italy and discover the best places to visit with these top itineraries.</p>

                  <h2>PISA</h2>
                  <p>While you could spend a week just seeing all the Renaissance wonders of Florence, you can easily add Pisa and two or three other Tuscan towns in a week's vacation. Handily, they are strung like beads along a route you can follow by train or bus. Because the regional trains don't require seat reservations, you can buy your ticket at the station in Florence and travel any time you wish (be sure to stamp it in the machine on the platform before you board). These towns are only 15 to 45 minutes apart.After at least two days in Florence, you can see the highlights of Prato and Pistoia easily in the same day. Prato's cathedral is illuminated by two 15th-century fresco cycles that show Filippo Lippi at the height of his artistry.
    
                    When you see Pistoia's medieval churches, you may wonder why it's not better known to tourists, but it remains blissfully serene, and you can tour its magnificent 13th-century Cattedrale di San Zeno almost in solitude. Don't miss the silver altar in the adjoining Cappella di San Iácopo or Andrea della Robbia's glazed terra-cotta relief above the central doorway. Across the piazza is a 14th-century baptistery faced with white and green marble.</p>
